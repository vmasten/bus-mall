# User Stories for Bus Mall Project

## Marketing Research
1. Interested in which items will sell best
2. Wants data to verify which items are most popular
3. Wants a simple website to be used for its research
4. Wants hard numbers when research is complete

## The Developer (Me!)
1. I want to use JS to build a simple, dynamic research tool
2. I want to track how often items are clicked on in order to effectively tabulate results for the client
3. I want to ensure unbiased user input by displaying approximately equal-szed images
4. Once I have a working tracker, I want to use HTML and CSS to make the page look appealing to my client

## Focus Group Participants
1. Need to be able to quickly grasp the task at hand
2. Should be presented with a friendly-looking interface to encourage participation
3. Will want the process to be quick and simple. Any friction is likely to cause disengagement
4. Will want results of their choices displayed at the end of the research session
