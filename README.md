# BusMall

A project using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to do market analysis on which displayed products are most desirable. Currently renders 3 non-duplicate, non-repeated product images at a time and asks the user to vote for which is the most desirable  while tabulating the votes. Once 25 choices have been made, the voting system is removed and the results are displayed.
